## Overview

Another quick and easy challenge. It was pretty fun figuring out the right colors to use for the shadows.

## My process

I think 95% of my process was helping my friend with chess, actually. This was a pretty easy one to knock out. I did get some more practice using `display: grid`, which I don't use that often.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did at a point realise I was overcomplicating things in some areas. I used to adjust the opacity of the color directly when I needed to, but I neglected that `opacity` already exists as a property. I only need to adjust it for box shadows. (Or maybe not even then?)

### Continued development

I want to tackle more advanced projects now. I'm pretty confident in HTML and CSS, I think.
